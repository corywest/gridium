# Gridium

Welcome to Gridium! Gridium helps you build better automated tests using only Selenium and your advanced knowledge of page objects.  This is a replacement gem for Capybara.  I found it more difficult to use Capybara with Firefox and Selenium, and wanted to take advantage of everything that Selenium offered and Capybara lacked.

Before you get started you should understand how page objects work.  A primer on Page Objects:
[Template Design Pattern](http://www.electricsheepdreams.com/blog/2014/12/4/template-design-pattern-the-first-avenger)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gridium'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gridium

## Usage

Comming Soon!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
